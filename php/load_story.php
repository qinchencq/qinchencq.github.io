           Zion Eyes wears lots of hat. He is a rapper, a slam poet, a writer, a journalist and a social activist. 
           He believes power is best manifested in pen and paper, reading and writing, criticizing and thinking. 
           His rhymes and beats represent an earthy township that in his eyes has not changed much since the end of Apartheid twenty years ago. 
           <br/>Zion raps with his friend Anele. They have pointed views and different mentalities, believing that reading and thinking is the best path to 
           follow away from the often short and troubled life found in the township.<br/><br/>

           Her struggles through high school are accentuated by the lack of teachers and textbooks, and made all the more desperate by the need to support her child. 
           Moving in with her grandmother has helped relieve some of the stress, but Sibz is still expected to work hard to contribute toward her family. 
           <br/>In one-way Sibz has followed in the ways of both her mother and grandmother, both of who were single teenage mothers. 
           Her mother, Bukiwe, was forced to leave school at the age of 17 when she became pregnant with Sibz, but she makes it clear that her daughter’s education means everything, 
           and will not be compromised.<br/><br/>

           "I live the life that I am living now because I can&#39;t do anything about it. 
           It is the life I have been given to live,” says Nombulelo Cunge, a resident of the Etembeni informal settlement in Extension 7. 
           With no electricity, sanitation, proper housing, access to information and very little running water, their only option is to hope that 
           one day the dream they voted for in 1994, for a better life, will be realized. 
           <br/>Etembeni is a community still feeling the legacy of Apartheid that left many South Africans poor, displaced, under-skilled and uneducated. 
           In an area with limited access to resources and information the residents of this close knit community spend their days 
           quietly trying to survive while continuing to hope and endure.

            “To waddle like a duck" or "to walk with protruded buttocks" are some of the English translations for the uniquely South African dance, pantsula. 
            Originating in Sophiatown in the 1950’s, pantsula represents and celebrates South African township life. 
            But there is much more to the vibrant, flat-footed, tap-and-glide style of dance that so many South Africans see performed in the streets.
            <br/>Pantsula is a street-style; it&#39;s a culture, a way of life. 
            However the dance has largely remained attached to the associations it has with the rebellious Apartheid-era youth; 
            the gangsters, the robbers and township thugs. Via Kasi Movers is a local pantsula dance group that is trying to break that stereotype by 
            using dance as a way of uniting people and as a way of steering those living in townships away from negative influences such as crime, drugs and alcohol.

           Richard Nzwana, a handsome and well-spoken man, lives a full life. 
           He is a father, husband, teacher, musician and music instructor, beekeeper, swimmer and skydiver. 
           He is a man on a mission to show the world that a blinded person can still live a normal life. 
           <br/>Richard is blind, but he is capable. He walks with purpose and direction without the aid of a cane or stick. 
           To see him walk by himself, one would be convinced Richard is sighted. Twenty-five years have passed since Richard lost his sight at the age of 12, 
           but he doesn’t allow his blindness to disable him. Sighted or not, he is an inspiration to his community.<br/><br/>

           Through his involvement in the Field Band Foundation, Sihle Noneze, 15, 
           is afforded the opportunity to live out the ambitions that his mother was forced to give up due to the political instability within South Africa under Apartheid.  
           Zuziwe, Sihle’s mother, dreamt of becoming a musician during her youth, but instead focused on her schooling to create a brighter future for her children. 
           <br/>She never finished school and now works as a “kitchen lady” to support Sihle and his siblings. 
           The Field Band Foundation is a youth development program that is providing children in the township with opportunities to learn various musical instruments and life skills, 
           providing the resources and training to make their dreams a reality.<br/><br/>
