		                    	When Adam Campbell was nine and Vuyisani Moni was 13, they were two boys enjoying all the joys of best friends growing up together: 
		                    	daily soccer games, watching wrestling on TV, sharing stories and sleepovers. 
		                    	Adam’s family lived on a farm just outside Grahamstown, and Vuyisani’s family stayed in a small house on the farm.

		                    	Adam is just about to finish high school, while Vuyisani is putting his IT qualifications to work in the local hospital.
